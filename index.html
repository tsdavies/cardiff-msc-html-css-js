        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> In the article, ‘A Model for Developing Computational Thinking Skills’
            (Palts, Tauno / Pedaste, Margus, Informatics in Education, 2020, Vol.
            19, No. 1, 113–128, Vilnius University) discusses a number of different
            views on computational thinking (CT) and after analysing ten CT skills,
            resolves in a model of defining the problem, solving the problem and
            analysing the solution. The ten skills that are discussed and my
            understanding of them are:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Problem formulation (discussing / documenting the problem)</li>

            <li>
                Abstraction (used to understand the problem by removing unnecessary
                details)
            </li>

            <li>
                Problem reformulation (discussing and documenting the problem
                post-abstraction)
            </li>

            <li>
                Decomposition (dividing the problem into smaller, more manageable
                parts)
            </li>
            <li>
                Data collection and analysis (gathering as much relevant data as
                possible whilst abstracting away the irrelevant)
            </li>

            <li>
                Algorithmic design (creating a step-by-step solution for the
                problem)
            </li>

            <li>Parallelisation and iteration (efficiency and reusability)</li>

            <li>
                Automation (parallelisation and iteration lead to the possibility of
                automating code, or processes)
            </li>

            <li>
                Generalisation (Generalising the solution for wider range of
                problems)
            </li>

            <li>
                Evaluation (Testing and evaluating the effectiveness of the
                solution)
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Main Content Section</h2>
        <p>
            Although most of the ten skills were at least touched on in the module,
            the ones we focused on were decomposition, abstraction, pattern
            recognition, and algorithmic design. I believe these four encompass most
            of the ten skills listed in the article in that decomposition and

            abstraction could contain problem formulation and data collection and
            analysis, pattern recognition might use automation, parallelisation and
            iteration, but so could algorithmic design, which could also include
            generalisation and evaluation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The world of computer science is changing
            rapidly, much like a planet is terraformed in a science-fiction story.
            The once-familiar landscape has become difficult to navigate,
            particularly with regards to the job market and defining roles with the
            rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Automation is featuring
            prominently in testing and whilst reusable tests and code can be
            beneficial, it pushes the required exploratory testing to the
            background. AI can generate code, and although it’s not perfect, it is
            cutting time, and therefore cost, from the software development cycle in
            some cases. I think the module content was useful and informative,
            however, I believe anyone looking to work in the technology industry
            would benefit from more knowledge around testing the code that we are writing and
            some automation, both of which developers and software testers are
            expected to have a basic understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the proposed model illustrated in Fig. 3. (a model for developing CT skills with
            illustrations from the project of measuring plant soil humidity) has
            merit in that it has three main objectives and within those are various
            tools that can be used for each. Having worked in the technology
            industry, I’ve seen this kind of thinking employed during planning
            sessions although not always in the order of defining the problem,
            solving the problem and then analysing the solution. One method, as a
            leader, if found to get people thinking in this way is through Action
            Learning Sets (ALS). It’s a way of getting a small group of people to
            come up with a solution to a problem that is time-boxed and follows a
            very specific order of discussion. More information about Action
            Learning Sets can be found on the References page, if interested. When
            working through problems where methods such as a formal ALS cannot be arranged, then the
            method taught on this module of decomposition, abstraction, pattern
            recognition, and algorithmic design is as good as any place to begin in
            creating a way of working.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            I believe with the right set of soft skills,
            such as good communication and working agreements, any well thought out
            model of computational thinking, providing it includes the four base
            skills we discussed on the module (decomposition, abstraction, pattern
            recognition and algorithmic design) can only be beneficial when solving
            a problem. Some of the other listed skills might be required depending
            on the industry and individuals involved, however, provided you have a
            model (such as the one in Fig. 3) and the skills required for each step
            are clarified in your plan and include the four base skills,
            computational thinking plays an important role in any problem-solving
            scenario, especially when dealing with technological solutionising.
