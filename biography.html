            <em>Grace Hopper</em>, born in New York City on December 9, 1906, was an American
            computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral. She earned her bachelor's
            degree in mathematics and physics from Vassar College in 1928, and then
            her master's and Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University by the 1930s.
            Hopper initially worked as a professor at Vassar before joining the Navy
            during World War II, where she was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance
            Computation Project at Harvard University. There, she worked on the
            Harvard Mark I, one of the earliest electromechanical computers. After
            the war, she remained involved with computing and rejoined the Navy
            until her retirement in 1986.

        </p>
        <p>
            Hopper is best known for her pioneering work in developing programming
            languages. One of her key achievements was creating the first compiler,
            a system that translates high-level programming languages into machine
            code, which formed the basis for the COBOL (Common Business-Oriented
            Language) programming language. COBOL became one of the most widely used
            languages in business and government applications and remains critical
            for many legacy systems. Additionally, Hopper coined the term
            "debugging" in computing after fixing a glitch caused by a moth in the
            Mark II computer.

        <p>
            Grace Hopper's contributions have had a lasting impact on modern
            computer science. Her development of the compiler revolutionized how
            software is written, enabling more efficient and user-friendly
            programming. The principles behind her work continue to influence the
            design of programming languages today, and COBOL is still used for
            critical systems worldwide. Hopper’s dedication to advancing
            computer science education, especially for women, has made her a lasting
            figure in both the history of computing and efforts to diversify the
            tech industry.

        <h2>My ChatGPT experience:</h2>
        <p>
            The prompt entered (displayed at the top of this page) is the second one, as the first one gave me
            unreliable references,
            so I changed to a persona-type prompt and added the words
            “please only use information that can be cross-checked for validity and
            provide references for your information that can be verified”. This second prompt was more reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I often find ChatGPT uses much more flowery language than is necessary,
            however this time the paragraphs were easy to read and did not repeat themselves.
            The only adjustments that I had to make to the biography were the removal of two words,
            as three hundred and two words were generated instead of three hundred.
        </p>
        <p>
            Three pieces of information I fact-checked were the subject Grace Hopper taught at Vassar College,
            if she truly coined the phrase “debugging”, and was coined after fixing a glitch caused by a moth in the
            Mark II computer?
            After questioning ChatGPT further, it claimed that both the facts of her teaching Mathematics at Vassar and
            that
            she found the moth in the could be verified in <i>Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age,</i>
            (Kurt W. Beyer. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2009)
            can be found here in our own library at Cardiff University. It stated that the National Museum of American
            History (Smithsonian)
            has exhibits and documentation of both the coining of the term and the moth taped inside. I was able to find
            an image of the moth on the Smithsonian digital archives
            (see reference page). However, ChatGPT did state that it might have been her team was attributed the coining
            of the phrase ‘debugging’
            but it was popularised in computing due to her influence. Overall, I found the sources ChatGPT provided were
            reliable and I enjoyed going down the rabbit hole.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found the entire experience quite enjoyable and even had Dall-E2 (AI image generator) create an
            approximate likeness of Grace Hopper,
            which I enjoyed prompting until the image was fairly close to a real photograph. Although there is
            controversy around using generative AI for any creative work,
            there is no doubt that it’s an enjoyable tool to use to help put an image to your ideas. I felt before
            embarking on this adventure that generative AI tools are just that: tools.
            There is no intelligence behind it, only algorithms, and scraping the internet for data that can often be
            outdated or completely wrong.
            It should always be approached with these things in mind. Having said that, for me personally, it has almost
            completely replaced search engines when I want to find information quickly.
