            The “Computational Thinking” module has been excellent, and I really enjoyed it.
            Much of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript learning were refreshers for me, having spent time in the industry as
            an automation test engineer,
            however, as a tester I did not have the opportunity to do web development itself, so the assessment was
            challenging and a learning experience.
            Some new things I learned, though, and found quite interesting were base number systems (as I haven’t done
            maths in school for thirty-five years)
            and I even found a way to use the modulus operator in my assessment, though I could not see a purpose for it
            until I researched further.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would have liked to learn more practical uses of computational thinking, perhaps examples of it used in
            planning for development (group work or exercises),
            and how it all comes together. However, I believe that other modules on the course will require what we have
            learned on this one applied to activities.
            Regardless, it has sparked my imagination, and I find myself considering how what I have learned can be
            applied to tasks, assessments and future projects.
            I would also have liked to explore JavaScript combined with the HTML and CSS we learned, perhaps even
            touching on React, which is still in high demand when
            looking forward to future employment and projects. It might have been good to have a lesson on Git, or
            version control in general and testing, as in any process,
            testing should begin as early as possible and it’s not only the domain of the ‘testers’. Testing is an
            excellent career path but very little is offered at
            university level to encourage it as a career. Accessibility is another topic that I would have liked to
            learn a bit about but I am happy to research it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Returning to the technology industry has been a challenge for me since the rise of generative AI and
            unsurety of required roles,
            with many after the big hires after the pandemic now, like me, having gone through redundancy. The skills I
            relearned,
            and new things learned on this module will help me face interviews with confidence in the skills I claim to
            already have and
            have given me a lot to think about in how I approach problem solving. I may even try my hand at a junior
            developer role to gain some practical experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            As previously stated, I really did enjoy this module and if it were up to me, I would want it to be a month
            longer at least.
            There was so much to unpack and go read about independently, however, I think we could have easily filled
            weeks with just web development, tooling and testing.
            I look forward to putting what I’ve learned to good use on future modules and when I get back out there into
            the working world.
